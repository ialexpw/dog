# dog (tell - Dog)
tellDog is a simple PHP monitoring system which utilises external ping servers. This allows you to check on the state of your servers as well as monitoring response times from around the world.

Ping servers can easily be installed by uploading a single file to external hosts, this file is solely used for checking response times to the selected website monitor.

tellDog is currently a WIP and is aiming for its first release in August.
